To call the apis all the methods have to come with "localchost:3000/table/action" (in case that you are hosting the app in your own pc and you donÂ´t have some port assignated) and send data in a json if required.

For example to delete a user you have to use the api, "localchost:3000/usuario/delete" and send a json with the id pf the user.

In case that you dont add some action, the code is going to get all the table that you put in the api.
